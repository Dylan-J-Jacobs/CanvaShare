Description:

This project is for a website page that allows users to share a room coded canvas to draw on. It will be a fully online program. In CanvaShare you make a room, or canvas, that a bunch of people can be invited to. On this large canvas the various participants that were invited can start drawing on the canvas with a variety of different brushes and a selection of colors from a wheel.

There can also be an invite user option on your canvas to have someone also be able to work on your claimed selection.

This project was made because I like creating art and also that sometimes art can be more fun if you have someone to share it with or someone to work on it with you or even periodically seeing drawings come up out of no where or people working while you are. This could also be great for classes where students can work together on something or students could submit assignments by claiming and drawing something while other students and teachers can see when someone pops in and starts drawing. Much cool wow!
